# rag-local-file-system
This is a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to turn personal document libraries into a searchable, interactive intelligence base. This solution keeps all data on your machine rather than in the Cloud, utilizing Ollama (Llama 3) and HuggingFace Embeddings for a 100% private experience.
